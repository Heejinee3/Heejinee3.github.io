          "The purpose of this lab is to learn or review the
          fundamentals of the C programming language, a portion of the 'decommenting' task of the C preprocessor, and how to use the
          GNU/Unix programming tools, especially bash, emacs, and gcc209.",
          "The task is to write a C program named wc209 that prints the number of
          lines, words, and characters in the input text fed from standard input to
          standard ouput. The program behaves similarly to Linux wc,
          but wc209 skips 'commented text'(e.g., text in /* ... */) and does not
          count such text in the output.",

          stateless modules in C, the 'design by contract' style of
