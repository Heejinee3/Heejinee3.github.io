#### **Instruction**

---

Ever wondered how you can use your database in the real world?

In this lab, you will implement a simple Web application based on a Cloud SQL
database. Instead of implementing an application from scratch, you will start with an
existing sample code (called Bookshelf) and extend it with simple functionalities (search
and rate books).

Throughout this lab, you will use multiple technologies: Google Cloud SQL
(for the database), Google App Engine (for hosting the Web application), Flask (for the Web
application), and SQLAlchemy (for communicating with the database).

<br>

#### **Task**

---

1. Demonstrate that you can successfully deploy the Bookshelf
   application.

2. Enable a user to rate books (say with 1 to 5 stars).

3. Enable a user to search for books (say by title and year).

Task 2 and 3 are open-ended, and you may use any database and UI designs you
want for the implementation. Also for simplicity, you may assume that you are the
only user of the system.
