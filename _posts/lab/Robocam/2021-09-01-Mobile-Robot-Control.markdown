#### **Problem Statement**

---

- Mobile Robot Control

  Implement three-wheeled mobile robot using servos and omni-wheels, and local keyboard controller for TMR to move and illuminate.

  We start from the simplest and perform step-by-step improvements.

1. Construct a Three-wheeled Mobile Robot (TMR)

   ```
   Construct a Three-wheeled Mobile Robot (TMR) using servos, omni-wheels, and lights.
   ```

2. Control Servo Command Example

   ```
   Test control servo via PWM with sysfs and command lines.
   ```

3. Control Servo Shell Script

   ```
   Implement control individual servo via PWM with shell script. Find each duty value to stop the servo.
   ```

4. Control TMR in C

   ```
   Implement control triple servos for TMR via PWM with C program with micro-sec input.
   ```

5. Local Keyboard Control for TMR Servos and Lights

   ```
   Implement local keyboard control of TMR on Bone to actuate servos and lights.
   ```
