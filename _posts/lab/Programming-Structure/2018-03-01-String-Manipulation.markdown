#### **Purpose**

---

The purpose of this assignment is to help you learn/review (1) arrays and pointers in the C programming language, (2) how to create and use stateless modules in C, (3) the "design by contract" style of programming, and (4) how to use the GNU/UNIX programming tools, especially bash, emacs, gcc, and gdb.

#### **Task**

---

The task in this assignment is to use C to create the "Str" module that provides string manipulation functions. Specifically, design your Str module so that each function behaves the same as described below.

The task in this assignment is twofold.

1. Read the description of the basic string library functions carefully, and implement each function. The basic functions are most commonly used standard string functions. Each function should behave the same as its corresponding standard C function.

2. Implement a simplified version of grep using Str functions. Read the provided file that contains skeleton code carefully, edit the file to make it process the required functionalities: find, replace, diff.
