#### **Purpose**

---

The purpose of this assignment is to help you learn about computer architecture, assembly language programming, and testing strategies. It also will give you the opportunity to learn more about the GNU/Unix programming tools, especially bash, emacs, gcc209, and gdb for assembly language programs.

#### **Task**

---

A Desk Calculator Program in Assembly Language

1. Implement basic functions of dc

   dc is a Unix-like operating system tool used for performing calculations. It reads numbers from standard input and uses command keys to display results on standard output. The implemented operations include printing (p), arithmetic operators (+, -, \*, /, %, ^), and a terminating operator (q). The % operator calculates the remainder, and the ^ operator performs exponentiation. Negative exponents are not supported.

2. Advanced functions

   dc tool for this lab requires the implementation of four operators: 'f' to print the stack contents in LIFO order, 'c' to clear the stack, 'd' to duplicate the top entry, and 'r' to swap the top two values on the stack. These operators provide additional functionality for manipulating the input stack.
