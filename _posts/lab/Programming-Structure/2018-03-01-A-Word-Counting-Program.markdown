#### **Purpose**

---

The purpose of this assignment is to help you learn or review (1) the fundamentals of the C programming language, (2) a portion of the "decommenting" task of the C preprocessor, and (3) how to use the GNU/Unix programming tools, especially bash, emacs, and gcc209.

<br>

#### **Task**

---

The task is to write a C program named wc209 that prints the number of lines, words, and characters in the input text fed from standard input to standard ouput. The program behaves similarly to Linux wc, but wc209 skips "commented text"(e.g., text in /_ ... _/) and does not count such text in the output.
