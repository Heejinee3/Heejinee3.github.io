#### **Purpose**

---

The purpose of this assignment is to help you learn how to implement common data structures in C and how to exploit them to achieve modularity in a real-world application. It also will give you the opportunity to gain more experience with the GNU/Linux programming tools, especially bash, emacs, and gdb.

#### **Task**

---

You will implement and improve the customer data management API using various data structures. Your task in this assignment is threefold:

1. Implement an API library for the customer data management, using a dynamically resizable array.

2. Implement the same API library using a hash table.

3. Test the correctness of your two libraries and measure the performance.
